 A marriage proposal in Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is very different from the classical computing we are all used to. I realized that the day I decided to learn the basics of this amazing field and write a simple Hello World! program. It is not just about printing a string on the screen, but about using the properties of Quantum Mechanics to solve a particular problem. I needed to come up with creative problem to solve!

**I found one:**

Months ago I proposed to my girlfriend Mari. Like in the quantum world of atoms and electrons, Mari was in a superposition state, a equal-weighted combination of two states: "Yes" and "No".

Then, one day I had the courage to measure the state. This step forced the reveal of the final state.

Yes, a proposal as a quantum problem.
